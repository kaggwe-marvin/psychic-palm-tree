## Technical Architecture Considerations

### Frontend
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Component-based architecture
- HTMX for interactive elements with minimal JavaScript
- Form validation library for DATA-001

### Backend
- MVC architecture for clear separation of concerns
- RESTful API endpoints for all major functions
- Middleware for authentication and role-based access control
- Data validation layer
- Service layer for business logic

### Database
- Relational database with the following key entities:
  - Users (id, name, email, role, department_id, etc.)
  - Departments (id, name, requirements, etc.)
  - ClearanceRequests (id, student_id, status, submitted_at, etc.)
  - Documents (id, request_id, department_id, file_path, status, etc.)
  - ActionLogs (id, user_id, action, timestamp, details, etc.)

## Risk Management

| Risk Area | Mitigation Strategy |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Data Consistency | Implement database transactions for multi-step processes |
| Security | Apply proper authentication, input validation, and CSRF protection |
| Performance | Optimize database queries and implement caching where appropriate |
| Scalability | Design with modular architecture to allow component scaling |
| User Adoption | Develop intuitive UI with tooltips and comprehensive documentation |
