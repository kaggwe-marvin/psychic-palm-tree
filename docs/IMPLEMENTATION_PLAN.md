# Folder Restructuring Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for reorganizing the folder structure of our Hono+JSX application with HTMX to improve maintainability and separation of concerns.

## Steps to Follow

### 1. Preparation
- [x] Create a backup of the entire project
- [x] Create restructuring scripts
- [x] Create documentation with new folder structure

### 2. Execute Restructuring
Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Make the restructure script executable
chmod +x restructure.sh

# Run the restructure script
./restructure.sh
```

### 3. Update Import Paths
Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Make the import update script executable
chmod +x update_imports.sh

# Run the import update script
./update_imports.sh
```

### 4. Manual Updates
Some import paths may need manual updates. Use VS Code's search functionality (Ctrl+Shift+F) to find any remaining references to old paths:

Search patterns to check:
- `from "../ui/`
- `from "../../ui/`
- `from "../components/ui/`
- `import { ... } from '../../organisms/`

### 5. Testing
After completing the restructuring:

1. Build the application to check for any TypeScript errors:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. Run the application locally to test functionality:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Verify that all pages and components load correctly

### 6. Commit Changes
Once everything is working correctly:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Refactor: Reorganize folder structure for better maintainability"
```

## Benefits of New Structure

### Atomic Design Implementation
The new structure better aligns with Atomic Design principles:
- **Atoms**: Basic building blocks (buttons, inputs, etc.)
- **Molecules**: Simple groups of UI elements functioning together
- **Organisms**: Complex UI sections composed of groups of molecules and/or atoms
- **Templates**: Page-level objects that place components into a layout
- **Pages**: Specific instances of templates that present real content

### Role-Based Organization
Components are now organized by their intended audience/role:
- Admin-specific components
- Staff-specific components
- Student-specific components
- Common components used across roles

### Clear Separation of Concerns
- UI components are separated from business logic
- Page components are separated from reusable components
- Context providers have their own dedicated location

## Next Steps After Restructuring
Once the restructuring is complete, consider implementing these additional improvements:

1. **Component Documentation**: Add JSDoc comments to top-level components
2. **Storybook Integration**: Set up Storybook for component visualization and testing
3. **Unit Tests**: Create unit tests for critical components
4. **Style Consolidation**: Review and consolidate style definitions
5. **Accessibility Audit**: Ensure components meet accessibility standards
