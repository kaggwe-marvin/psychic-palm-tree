# Common Organisms

This directory contains complex UI components shared across multiple user roles.

## Components

- `Header`: Application header component
- `Navbar`: Navigation component
- `Sidebar`: Sidebar navigation component
- `AuthFormComponent`: Authentication form component

## Usage Guidelines

1. Components in this directory should be designed for reuse across different user roles
2. Keep components role-agnostic or implement role-based rendering internally
3. Use composition over inheritance
4. Implement HTMX attributes consistently
5. Document public API and expected props
